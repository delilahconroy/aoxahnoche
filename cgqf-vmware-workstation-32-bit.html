HI All, My question is, Can I make the Guest OS use A memory stick to increase the Amount of available RAM for the Guest OS? Because Fair warning, this one is a little long.

Even worse, I did have a security camera looking at the driveway, but like an idiot only had it set up to record motion which it never picked up. Lessons learn. VMware Workstation Pro Lets You Run Multiple Operating Systems as Virtual Machines (including Windows VMs) . Does Workstation 15 Pro support 32-bit operating systems?
